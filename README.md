Generation Changer Coin
================================



Generationchanger is a lite version of Bitcoin using scrypt as a proof-of-work algorithm.

For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of 
the Generationchanger client software, see http://www.generationchangercoin.com 
<h3>Development process</h3> Developers work in their own trees, then submit pull requests when they think
their feature or bug fix is ready.

If it is a simple/trivial/non-controversial change, then one of the Generationchanger
development team members simply pulls it.

If it is a *more complicated or potentially controversial* change, then the patch
submitter will be asked to start a discussion with the devs and community.

The patch will be accepted if there is broad consensus that it is a good thing.
Developers should expect to rework and resubmit patches if the code doesn't
match the project's coding conventions (see `doc/coding.txt`) or are
controversial.

The `master` branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be
completely stable. [Tags](https://github.com/generationchanger-project/generationchanger/tags) are created
regularly to indicate new official, stable release versions of Generationchanger.

Testing
-------

Testing and code review is the bottleneck for development; we get more pull
requests than we can review and test. Please be patient and help out, and
remember this is a security-critical project where any mistake might cost people
lots of money.
